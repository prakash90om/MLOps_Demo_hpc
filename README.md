# Introduction (Image Augmentation)
Image augmentation can be simply described as any image processing method that makes our dataset larger. To create more images for example, we could flip, rotate, zoom the input image and save a result.

* ### Images augmentation
	* Rotation
	* Horizontal Flip
	* Vertical Flip
	* Zoom

## Compilation and Build
Compilation is done using, Makefile, which defines set of tasks to be executed. 
We have used make to compile a program from source code to generate the executable files.
Object/executable files are generated by make into build directory.

* #### OpenMP: To compile only OpenMP based files.
	* make omp
* #### CUDA: To compile CUDA files.
	* make cuda
* #### All: To compile All files.
	* make all
